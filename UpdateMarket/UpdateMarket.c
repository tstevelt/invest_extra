	Synopsis: 
	Distribution Days: These are days where the Nasdaq or S&P 500 are down 
	significantly (0.20%) on higher volume than the prior day â€” a sign of
	institutional selling (also known as distribution). When you see a string
	of distribution days in a short amount of time, it often means the current
	uptrend is starting to roll over into a correction.For example, if you 
	get 5 - 7 distribution days within a 4 - 5 week period, the Market Pulse
	will typically change from "Confirmed uptrend" to "Uptrend under pressure."
	And if distribution days continue to mount, the Market Pulse will likely 
	switch from "Uptrend under pressure" to "Market in correction."
